        - "Age of the animal - Young animals produce milk with a higher butterfat content than older animals."
        - "Condition of the animal - Under extreme emaciation, there is a substantial drop in the butterfat content of the milk."
        - "Stage of lactation and pregnancy - The butterfat content in milk tends to be higher in the middle phase of the lactation period. Hormonal changes in a pregnant lactating animal are responsible for the lactation trends in milk composition."
        - "Completeness of milking - The last milk drawn from the udder produces 10% of the total fats in milk. Milk produced in the morning has a lower fat content than that drawn in the evening."
        - "Breed differences - Most of these differences are more pronounced in terms of fat content."
        - "Season of the year - Fat % increases during cold seasons of the year."
        - "The type of food eaten by the animal - The volatile fatty acids produced in the rumen of the animal influence the composition of milk. Propionic acid is from grain feeds, while acetic acid is from roughages. An animal eating large quantities of roughages produces milk with high fats, proteins, and lactose compared to an animal fed on a lot of grains."
        - "Other factors - For example, diseases like mastitis reduce lactose composition, and animals under treatment may be affected."

        Marks: 1
      - Subquestion: "ii) Why does the air current marked F flow at night"
        Answer: "At night, land loses heat faster than the sea. Air over the land becomes cooler and heavier than that over the sea. The relatively warmer air over the sea is lighter and rises, while the cooler, heavier air over the land flows towards the sea to replace the rising air."
        Marks: 3
    - Subquestion: "b) Give a reason why air cools as it rises"
      Answer: "As air rises, it expands, spreading out its molecules over a wider area, and thus becomes cooler."

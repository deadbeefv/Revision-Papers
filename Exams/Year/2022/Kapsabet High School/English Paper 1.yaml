- Question: |
    You are the H.O.D, English and library in your school. You ordered for some textbooks online as reference materials for students and teachers in the library. 
    Everything was done according to order.  The books were delivered to the school; received by the storekeeper for entry into the stores ledger; and, then passed on to the librarian for processing ready for the various readers in library. 
    A cheque was raised as payment. When you went through them  however, you discovered that the books have faults.   For instance, there is one title with 2 missing pages;  the History  text book  has wrong facts.  
    For example it says that Mwai Kibaki was the 1st president of Tanzania; and the binding is poor. The papers easily come off. All this is unfortunate.  You have decided to return the books to the sender. 
    Request them to send correct copies of the books or can they refund the money?

    This should be sent to:
    The sales manager,
    The Kenya literature bureau – Kenya
    P.O. Box 1300 – 50102
    NAIROBI.

    This should be written through your principal.

    Dear Sir/Madam,

    RE: Request for Replacement of Faulty Textbooks

    I trust this letter finds you well. I am writing to address a matter concerning a recent order of textbooks made by our institution, [Your School Name]. I am the Head of the English Department and Library at our school, and I am writing on behalf of our principal to bring to your attention some issues with the textbooks that were delivered to us.

    The order for reference materials, which was placed through your esteemed organization, was delivered to our school and received by our storekeeper on [Date of Delivery]. The textbooks were subsequently entered into our stores ledger and handed over to the librarian for further processing to be made available for our students and teachers in the library. A payment was made for the order through a raised cheque.

    Upon thorough inspection of the delivered textbooks, it has come to our attention that there are significant issues with their quality. Regrettably, we have identified the following faults:

    One title is missing two pages, which impacts the completeness and usability of the textbook.
    The History textbook contains incorrect facts, such as stating that Mwai Kibaki was the 1st president of Tanzania. This factual inaccuracy undermines the educational value of the book.
    The binding of the textbooks is of poor quality, resulting in pages easily detaching from the spine. This compromises the durability and usability of the textbooks over time.
    Given the importance of accurate and reliable educational materials for our students and teachers, we find these issues to be highly unfortunate and unacceptable. As such, we kindly request that you take appropriate action to rectify this situation. We have decided to return the faulty textbooks to your organization and would appreciate it if you could arrange for the following:

    Send us correct and complete copies of the affected textbooks as replacements.
    Alternatively, process a refund for the cost of the faulty textbooks.
    We understand that errors can occur, but we believe that prompt and decisive action will uphold the integrity of our educational resources and maintain our students' learning experience. We kindly ask for your prompt attention to this matter and hope for a swift resolution.

    Please address the replacement or refund process to the attention of the officer responsible for receiving such requests. If necessary, please provide guidance on the steps we need to follow to facilitate the return of the faulty textbooks and the subsequent replacement or refund process.

    Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. We look forward to a timely resolution that ensures the quality and accuracy of the educational resources we provide to our students.

    Yours faithfully,

    Your Full Name
    Head of English Department and Library

        Bushbaby and Chameleon
        A long time ago, all the animals of the forest called a meeting. At the meeting, it was decided to organize a racing content to determine the fastest animal in the jungle.
        Among the participants in the race was the famous Bushbaby. Now, Bushbaby was the most feared animal in the forest on account of her speed and agility. The other animals felt that this was going to be a walkover for Bushbaby. And so they all hesitated. Even other fast runners like Antelope and Gazelle hesitated. However, Chameleon came forward and said he  would compete against Bushbaby. Now, this drew a jeer from the crowd. Who didn’t know that  Chameleon was among the  slowest animals in the jungle?
        This, however, didn’t discourage him. He reiterated his decision to challenge Bushbaby in the race. The race started with  the blowing of a whistle. Bushbaby set off like lightning.  But before she could pass Chameleon, the latter threw his hands out and held onto Bushbaby’s long hairy tail. He clung to it like a magnet.
        At the finish line, Chameleon was the first to sit down. As Bushbaby was preparing to sit, she heard a firm voice from behind her.
        “Hey,  my friend. Don’t sit on me”. This was Chameleon talking. He had won the race.
        And there ends my story. But may I not end with it.

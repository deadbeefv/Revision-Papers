- Question: "Explain why a solution of hydrogen chloride in water turns blue litmus paper red but a solution of hydrogen chloride in methylbenzene has no effect on litmus paper."
  Answer: "HCl(g) ionizes in water to form an acidic solution, which can turn blue litmus paper red due to the presence of hydrogen ions (H+). However, in methylbenzene, HCl(g) gas remains molecular and does not ionize. As a result, the solution of hydrogen chloride in methylbenzene has no effect on litmus paper since it does not contain hydrogen ions to exhibit acidic properties."

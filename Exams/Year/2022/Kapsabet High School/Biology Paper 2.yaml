  Answer: 
    - "Plant and animal breeding: Breeding is done by artificial selection, either through inbreeding or crossbreeding, to selectively choose plants and animals with desirable qualities for breeding. Crossbreeding increases heterozygosity and often results in hybrid vigor, producing offspring with desirable traits."

    - "Genetic counseling: Specialists provide information and advice on genetically inherited disorders, risks, and outcomes to help individuals make informed decisions."
    - "Genetic engineering: Desirable genes are identified, isolated, and transferred from one organism to another, leading to the production of useful substances and genetically modified organisms (transgenics) for increased crop and animal production."
    - "Crime detection: Genetic techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting, are used to analyze DNA patterns and compare them with samples obtained from crime scenes or suspects, aiding in solving crimes and determining disputed parentage."
    - "Cloning: Tissue culture techniques allow the cloning of plants, resulting in the production of new crop varieties."

  Subquestions:
    - Subquestion: "a) Describe the process of fertilization in a flowering plant."
      Answer: 
        - "Pollen grains stick to the stigma surface, which produces chemical substances stimulating the pollen grain to germinate and form a pollen tube."

        - "The generative nucleus divides, producing two male nuclei, while the embryo sac in the ovule has eight nuclei."
        - "When the pollen tube reaches the micropyle, the tube nucleus disintegrates, and one male nucleus fuses with the egg cell to form a zygote."
        - "The other male nucleus fuses with the two polar nuclei to form triploid nuclei, which develop into endosperm."
        - "This process involves double fertilization, where both the zygote and endosperm are formed."
